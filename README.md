# kagi-web-search

A Node.js CLI tool that searches Kagi.com using session tokens and returns structured JSON data matching Kagi's official search API schema.

Unlike the official Kagi Search API which requires API access, this tool uses your existing Kagi session to perform searches and parse the HTML results into the same JSON format.


## Why?

The [Kagi Search API](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/overview.html) requires a separate API key, which are invite-only at the moment. If you already have a Kagi subscription and want to programmatically search from scripts or tools, this CLI provides an alternative by:

- Using your existing Kagi session token (no additional API costs)
- Parsing Kagi's HTML search results into structured JSON
- Matching the official API response format for compatibility


## Showcase

### Basic search with environment variable

```bash
# Show help
kagi-search

# Set your session token once
export KAGI_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token_here

# Search and get JSON results
kagi-search "steve jobs"
```

### Search with token flag

```bash
# Pass token directly
kagi-search "machine learning" --token your_session_token_here
```


### JSON output format

Results match the Kagi Search API schema:

- **Search Results** (`t: 0`): Web search results with `url`, `title`, `snippet`
- **Related Searches** (`t: 1`): Suggested search terms in `list` array

The output is wrapped in a `data` object for consistency with API standards.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "t": 0,
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs",
      "title": "Steve Jobs - Wikipedia",
      "snippet": "Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American businessman..."
    },
    {
      "t": 1,
      "list": ["steve jobs death", "steve jobs quotes", "steve jobs film"]
    }
  ]
}
```


## Authentication

Get your Kagi session token:

1. Visit [Kagi Settings](https://kagi.com/settings/user_details) in your browser
2. Copy the **Session Link**
3. Extract the `token` value from the link
4. Use that value as your session token

**Security Note**: Keep your session token private. It provides access to your Kagi account.


## Installation

```bash
npm install -g git@github.com:czottmann/kagi-web-search.git
```

## Tips

Kagi's **search operators** work, of course: [Kagi Keyboard Shortcuts and Search Operators | Kagi's Docs](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/search-operators.html#search-operators-1).

Since you're basically using the web search, **this tool inherits the setting in your account**. For example you can:

- Block or promote websites (results personalization)
- Select to receive longer or shorter search snippets (under [Kagi Settings â†’ Search](https://kagi.com/settings/search))

**For LLM or agent use,** I recommend to prevent bleeding your secret session token into the wild, and going with the included [kagi-search-wrapper.sh](kagi-search-wrapper.sh) instead. It's a tiny shell wrapper around the tool which loads the token from a file in your home folder. (Read the file, it's simple.)


## Technical Details

- **HTML Parsing**: Uses Kagi's `/html/search` endpoint for server-side rendered results
- **Authentication**: Session token via Cookie header
- **Error Handling**: Network errors, invalid tokens, parsing failures
- **User Agent**: Mimics Safari browser for compatibility
